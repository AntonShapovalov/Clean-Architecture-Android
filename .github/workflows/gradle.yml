# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# This workflow will build a Java project with Gradle and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-gradle
# Step "Setup Gradle" is used to configure Gradle for optimal use in GitHub Actions, including caching of downloaded dependencies.
# See: https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/main/setup-gradle/README.md
