# Clean Architecture for Android
Project demonstrates `how to` build domain driven clean architecture using Kotlin Coroutines, JetPack Compose and Android MVVM approach.

> Work in progress...
> App is going to search movies using [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com) and contains three screens:
> 1. Movies list - in progress
> 2. Search history - in progress
> 3. Movie details - planned

### Key points
Overall, the application architecture provides a solid foundation for building a clean and maintainable code. It emphasizes the importance of separating concerns, isolating the core business logic, and making the code testable and reusable.

#### Independent Business Logic in Domain Layer
* This is a core principle of clean architecture. The domain layer encapsulates the core business rules and logic, independent of any external frameworks or technologies. This makes it easier to test and maintain.

#### Unit Testability
* The absence of external dependencies in the domain layer makes it easier to write [unit tests](#test-coverage) that quickly and reliably verify the correctness of the business logic.

#### Data Layer as a Single Source of Truth
* The data layer provides and manages data, acting as a single source of truth. This ensures data consistency and unidirectional data flow.

#### App Layer's Role
* The app layer primarily focus on presenting data to the user and passing events to the data layer. It also observes data streams to update the UI as needed. This separation of concerns helps to keep the app layer clean and focused.

#### Single Responsibility Principle
* Each layer and class has a well-defined purpose and [structure](#modules-structure). Data layer only provides data, domain layer applies data transformations and app layer only displays data. This makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
* The single responsibility principle is applied to each class, meaning that a class has only one reason to change. This helps to keep classes focused and manageable. For example, view only displays data, view-model only keeps UI state and so on.

#### Dependency Inversion
* The dependency inversion principle ensures that the domain layer does not depend on the data or app layer, but rather the other layers depend on the domain layer. This makes the code more flexible and testable.

### Test coverage

As the [Kover report](https://antonshapovalov.github.io/Clean-Architecture-Android/) indicates, all the business logic is encapsulated inside domain use cases and fully covered with unit tests.

### Modules structure
Application contains three modules:
- **app** - Android module with UI and framework dependencies, e.g. JetPack Compose to display views
- **data** - Android module with data dependencies, e.g. Retrofit to get data from the remote API
- **domain** - pure Java/Kotlin module without any external dependencies
